# Logistic-Regression

Logistic Regression is a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification problems. Unlike Linear Regression, which is used for predicting continuous values, Logistic Regression is used for predicting discrete values, typically binary values (0 or 1). For example, it can be used to predict whether a person will click on an ad or not, based on certain features like age, gender, etc.

The basic idea behind Logistic Regression is to model the probability of a certain event occurring (e.g. a person clicking on an ad) given certain input features (e.g. age, gender, etc.). The model uses a sigmoid function (also known as a logistic function) to map any real-valued input to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability.

The logistic function looks like this:

Here, z is a linear combination of the input features, given by:

where θ are the parameters (or weights) of the model, and x are the input features.

The logistic function maps z to a probability between 0 and 1. If the probability is greater than 0.5, we classify the instance as positive (1), and if the probability is less than or equal to 0.5, we classify the instance as negative (0).

The parameters θ are learned using maximum likelihood estimation, which involves finding the values of θ that maximize the likelihood of the observed data. This is typically done using optimization algorithms like gradient descent.

Logistic Regression is a simple yet powerful algorithm that is widely used in various applications, including healthcare, finance, and marketing, among others.
